                <br>
                <p>Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting animal species and their
                    habitats. It is achieved partially through legislation such as the Endangered
                    Species Act, the establishment and protection of public lands, and responsible
                    public practices that conserve wild animal populations. Read answers to the
                    following FAQs to learn how wildlife is protected in the United States</p>

            <h1>What does the Endangered Species Act do?</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p>The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 is our nation’s strongest law
                protecting wild plants and animals. It is enforced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
                Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Under the ESA, a
                species can be designated as “threatened” or “endangered”. Threatened and
                endangered species are protected under the provisions of the ESA, which
                restricts human activities that may harm these species and their habitats. Due
                in part by protections under the ESA, many species have been brought back from
                the brink of extinction.</p>

            <p>The wildlife comprises all living organism (plants, animals, microorganisms)
                in their natural habitats which are neither cultivated or domesticated nor
                tamed. But in its strictest sense, it includes uncultivated mammals, reptiles,
                birds and fishes etc. Certain importance of wildlife as below:The wildlife

                    Gene Bank: The Wildlife serves as a gene banks for breeding improved varieties
                    in agriculture, animal husbandry and fishery. Plant and animal breeders have
                    been able to produce high-yielding and disease-and-stress resistant varieties
                    which form the backbone of modern agriculture. Hence, gene bank maintenance is
                    essential.

                    Plant Propagation: Pollination in certain plants is performed by wild animals
                    like birds; insects etc. and thus help in plants propagation, which is very
                    essential.

                    animals, convert them into different nutrients and release energy back to the
                    nature increasing fertility of the soil. They do very important work of cleaning
                    the environment; otherwise what the fate of this planet will be, can be assumed.

            <h1>The Reason Why wildlife conservation is important</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Wildlife conservation refers to the well-planned practice of ensuring protection
                for wild animal species, their habitats, and plants. More or less, the truth
                about wildlife is that our future generations should be allowed to enjoy the
                Mother Nature while recognizing the unshaken importance of wildlife towards our
                wellbeing and surroundings.

            <p>
                As wildlife conservation has become a need of the pressing demands which modern
                people must address, the following are some key points signifying the importance
                of conserving wildlife.
